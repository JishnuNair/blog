Other times I think  
There's more to this  
There's just something  
Something big I'm missing  
  
I have been blessed  
To be loved  
To have loved  
To live  
  
There's much more to life  
Than the demons inside me  
There's much more to life  
Than death  
  
You made it this far, didn't you?  
Of course you had help  
More help than you care to acknowledge  
Tons of help, good fortune and love  
  
So just be grateful, you thick fuck  
Life is the biggest mystery there is  
You have so much more to unravel  
So much more to live for  
  
Other times I realize  
I am just too fortunate  
To be loved, have loved  
To live
