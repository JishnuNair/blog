As usual these might sound like a bunch of pointless questions, but still. Have you ever wondered:

**Who am I?**

**What am I here for?** 

**How is it that I can do all these things that I can do?**

Have you ever had a moment when you were doing something commonplace and suddenly it hits you. Like your soul got out of your body, or you feel like you were watching yourself from another person's perspective and wondering about what you were doing. You feel so detached from your body. How could you ever explain it to the person you were talking to when it happened. 
> "Hey. The weirdest thing just happened. I just felt like I was detached from my body. Like I was suddenly free of all these repetitions that I was doing, out of all these loops. Like I was just born, and was looking all the raw data flowing through. Nothing really making any sense. The buildings that we have made. The chairs that we sit on. The dresses that we were wearing. The identity cards. It lasted only for a moment though. My mind snapped back to the loop. Warmth spread over me. And I felt I was back. Have you ever felt it? The moment of truth?"

He probably would never have felt it. How could you ever make him understand what you felt in that split second. It really was a split second. A dreamscape free from time. You could never comprehend what was happening, but it was really something. Maybe this is what LSD would be like, if it is like what they say it is. A rebirth. Watch your hands move at your will, and wonder. Watch the people move in eternal loops, and wonder. Your hands moving through water, creating ripples. Watch yourself communicating with people, with machines. 
**And wonder**.

You begin to like the dreamscape. It feels like being enlightened. But remember what Hayao Miyazaki said. Life is mysterious and amazing, but you got work to do. It doesn't really make sense to wile away your time in the dreamscape. Go, apply yourself! Pass on your limited knowledge. Your love. Improvise your surroundings. Make it better for you and for us.

You got work to do now. Try and stay calm :)
