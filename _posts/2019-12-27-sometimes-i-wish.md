Sometimes I think  
I'm carrying too much  
Sisyphus may have liked it  
I don't  
  
Sometimes I wish  
To jump off the highest building  
To feel the fear crashing down  
Till my brains paint the earth  
  
Sometimes I wish  
To slash my veins  
Watch the blood splash out  
Like in a Kurosawa movie  
  
Sometimes I wish  
I were dead  
To shout at the world  
"LIFE IS SUFFERING, YOU FOOLS!"
