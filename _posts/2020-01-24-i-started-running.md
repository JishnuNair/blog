It would be wrong to say "I did it!" 
Of course I didn't 
I haven't reached anywhere 
But I've started running 


That means I wake early 
Every day 
And question myself 
Isn't it better to just sleep? 


Whatever I think, I rise up anyway 
Take a dump 
Now I'm not sleepy anymore 
Why not go jogging then? 


Let's make it quick then 
At least I can listen to some music 
Maybe beat yesterday's pace 
Screw it let's do it 


I then set out 
As slow as possible 
I'm already tired 
Maybe I should just walk the rest 


I don't stop somehow 
I reach the half way point 
Now it's easier, isn't it? 
Of course it isn't 


I should reach the end, somehow 
Why does it hurt so much? 
But I do see it  
The end 


Maybe I'll run some more 
Maybe I have a bit more left 
But yes I did it 
For today at least
