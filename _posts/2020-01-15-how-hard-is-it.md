Really. How hard is it? To get your ass moving? 

Just jog. At a snail's pace. Or even just walk. Crawl. Whatever. 

Just do something for an hour, and not feel this disapointment.


You don't really have to get to the finish line of a marathon. 
You're not looking for that. If you get moving now, it may be possible sometime. 
But that's not the point. The point is, you allowed yourself to be this way.
You allowed yourself to feel this, and you struggle to find justifications for 
feeling like shit. 

So what was your justification for today? "__It was too cold when I woke up__".
Give me a break, you piece of shit. I know there is this phrase called
"listen to your heart" and all, but don't do that sometimes. Your body just lied to you,
and you just lay cuddled up in that lie, and missed all the glory. You missed an
opportunity. 


Anyways. Enough of all that. Today happened, and today is done. Here's the deal from now on.
It's called the **"Two Day Rule"**. It's simple. Too simple, infact.
You don't take rest for two consecutive days. Ever. **Ever**. 

That's it. Mike drop. I don't care what your excuse is. I don't care if you have cancer.
I don't care if you had to amputate one leg. I don't care. I don't. You move your ass for an hour.
Even if it is to walk, or crawl. You just do it. Every. Single. Day.
